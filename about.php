      <h2><span><center>The Food Corner Story</center></span></h2>
    </div>
    <div><p>It is said that the best ideas are those that are born out of personal experiences. And it was one such experience from which GAGAN GULATI(the founder and CEO) started FOOD CORNER. With hunger pangs hitting his stomach hard, he searched online for good restaurants to order in from, during a late night working session. But as luck would have it, no such information was available online. And that&rsquo;s how the idea of starting an online food ordering portal came to him.Food Cornerwas launched on 26 July, 2006, with just 15 restaurants on board for the noble cause of waging war against hunger.We received our first round of funding during this time from the Indian Angel Network. This new investment capital helped us gradually expand into other cities and develop our business on a larger scale.On 17th January, 2011, another significant development occurred when we announced our partnership with JUST EAT Group, the leading online portal for ordering food ordering services that operates in 13 countries around the globe, including: Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.Today, we have over 3,000 restaurants on board, more than 6 lakh registered users, and some of the brightest minds working for the noble cause.Having the advantage of JUST EAT Group&rsquo;s best practices at our disposal, our strong local knowledge and technical prowess, we believe we are just a few steps away from being present in a customer&rsquo;s life, such that when they think of ordering food, they think Food CORNER</p></div>
